## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This application utilizes a robust client-server architecture:
- **Frontend**: A dynamic single-page application built with React and hosted on Vercel.
- **Backend**: A RESTful API built with Node.js/Express and hosted on Render, handling all business logic and database interactions.
- **Database**: A NoSQL MongoDB cluster hosted on Atlas for scalable and flexible data storage.
- **Real-Time Layer**: A persistent WebSocket connection managed by Socket.IO ensures immediate data synchronization.
