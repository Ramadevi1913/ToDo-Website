## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The application follows a standard client-server model:

*   The **React Frontend**, hosted on Vercel, serves the user interface.
*   The **Node.js/Express Backend**, hosted on Render, provides a RESTful API for all data operations.
*   **MongoDB Atlas** serves as the cloud-hosted NoSQL database.
*   **Socket.IO** establishes a persistent WebSocket connection between the client and server for real-time communication.
